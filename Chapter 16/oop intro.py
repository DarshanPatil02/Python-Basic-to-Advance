# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# COMMON TOPIC IN ALMOST ALL POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (PYTHON, C++, JAVA)
# WITH COMMON IDEA WITH DIFFERENT SYNTAX 

# OOP IS JUST A STYLE TO WRITE CODE

# VERY HELPFUL IN CREATING REAL WORLD PROGRAMS

# Most common word used in oop are class,object(instance), method
# e.g.

# Class : --->
#Define a class, which is like a blueprint for creating an object Use classes to create new objects
# list is a class which is in-built in python.

# Object (Instance) --->
"""
While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that's built from a class 
and contains real data like in above case list is class and l,l1,l2,stc are objects
e.g:--> l, l1, l2,etc are objects or instances
"""

l = [1,2,3,4,5]   
l1 = [5,8,9,58] 
l2 = ["Orange","mango","apple"]

# Method --->
"""Classes define functions called methods, 
which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
e.g: - append, delete, insert, pop, etc
"""
l.append(6)
l.pop(2)
